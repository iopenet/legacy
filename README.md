                First developed nearly 20 years ago, the original XOOPS was based on PHPNuke forks,  
                although about 70 to 80% of the code was rewritten, as Kazumi Ono (onokazu) wrote on  
                the release announcement. Goghs Cheng (goghs) and Kazumi Ono (onokazu) used "OOPS",  
                an acronym that stands for "Object-Oriented Portal System".  
                - Xoops.org was launched on December 12, 2001. 
                - A few weeks later, on New Year's Day 2002, XOOPS RC1 was released. 
                - And the next year, in April 2003, XOOPS2 was released by Kazumi Ono 
                - Finally, in May 2005, Onokazu announced the development of XOOPSCube.  
                The XOOSCube Project developoment was lead by Kazuhisa Minato (minahito)
                and the core team members Nobunobu, Onokazu, Tom_G3X, Ryuji, Kilica.
                The new core was enriched with C++ features, object-oriented programming, 
                following concept of oops like polymorphism, inheritance, encapsulation, 
                abstraction. The Japanese XOOPS community contributed to the development 
                of the Package Legacy, a set of modules to ensure backward compatibility.

# XOOPSCUBE - Simple, Secure and Scalable

## Web Application Platform

## Self-host  

XOOPSCube is a self-hosted open source application that runs on the most popular web server stack - Apache, MySQL, PHP. Self-hosted platforms are decentralized, allow for superior accessibility for customizing functions and style, which means you are not dependent on a centralized service and are free to choose your hosting service. This allows for extreme mobility when your number of users increase.

## Compatibility mode

XOOPSCube Legacy compatibility mode features a mechanism in which the XOOPSCube Web Application Platform emulates the older version, and mimics the XOOPS2 content management system in order to allow older or incompatible modules and themes to remain compatible with the newer software architecture. 

## Backward compatibility  

Legacy backward compatibility is a property of XOOPSCube that allows for interoperability with the older XOOPS2 system.  
It refers to the ability of newer versions of XOOPSCube to run modules or themes that worked under the previous version.

## Minimalist software
  
In computing, minimalism refers to the application of minimalist philosophies and principles in the design and use of hardware and software. Minimalism, in this sense, means designing systems that use the least hardware and software resources possible.

Extensibility
====
You can add functions to your website by installing modules. Modules can be easily add by installation wizard.
XOOPS Cube 2.1 has high compatibility with the earlier XOOPS 2.0.x. We recommend the last modules generation, known as Cube modules and D3 modules which can be easily duplicated and renamed but also provide a GUI to manage the language catalog and templates.
XOOPS Cube functionality can also be easily extended with Preloads - one file class based extension.
