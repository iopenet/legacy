        <h3>Using OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications</h3>
        <p>This document explains how web server applications use Google API Client Libraries or
            Google OAuth 2.0 endpoints to implement OAuth 2.0 authorization to access Google APIs.</p>
        <p>OAuth 2.0 allows users to share specific data with an application while keeping their
            usernames, passwords, and other information private. For example, an application can
            use OAuth 2.0 to obtain permission from users to store files in their Google Drives.</p>
        <p>This OAuth 2.0 flow is specifically for user authorization. It is designed for applications
            that can store confidential information and maintain state. A properly authorized web server
            application can access an API while the user interacts with the application or after the user
            has left the application.</p>
        <p>Web server applications frequently also use
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account" target="_blank">service accounts</a>
            to authorize API requests, particularly when calling Cloud APIs to access project-based data rather than user-specific data.
            Web server applications can use service accounts in conjunction with user authorization.</p>

        <h3>How do I authorize Google API?</h3>
        <p>All requests to the API must be authorized by an authenticated user.</p>
        <p>Both Sign In With Google and One Tap authentication include a consent screen which tells users the application
            requesting access to their data, what kind of data they are asked for and the terms that apply.</p>

        <h3>Root folder ID </h3>
        <p>You can set the root_folder_id for X-elFinder. This is the directory (identified by its Folder ID) considered to be the root of your drive.</p>
        <p>Normally you will leave this blank and X-elFinder will determine the correct root to use itself.</p>

        <p>However, you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder hierarchy or to access data within the "Computers" tab on the drive web interface
            (where files from Google's Backup and Sync desktop program go).
        </p>
        <p>In order to do this you will have to find the Folder ID of the directory you wish X-elFinder to display.</p>
        <h3>What is the Folder ID Google Drive?</h3>
        <p>This will be the last segment of the URL when you open the relevant folder in the drive web interface.</p>
        <p>So if the folder you want X-elFinder to use has a URL which looks like in the browser:<br>
            <pre>https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh</pre>
        <p>then you use <code>1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh</code> as the "root folder_id" in the settings of Google Drive API.</p>

        <p>NB. folders under the "Computers" tab seem to be read only (drive gives a 500 error)</p>>.
        <p>There doesn't appear to be an API to discover the folder IDs of the "Computers" tab - please contact us if you know otherwise!</p>
        <p>Note also that X-elFinder can't access any data under the "Backups" tab on the Google Drive web interface.</p>
        <h3>My Drive</h3>
        <p>Each user has a "root" folder called "My Drive" that functions as their primary hierarchy,
            and consists of everything that descends from this root folder. The user is the primary owner of this folder.</p>
        <h3>Shared drives</h3>
        <p>A shared drive is an organizational structure within Google Drive that lives parallel to My Drive.
           You can organize an individual file within a shared drive or in My Drive but not both.</p>
