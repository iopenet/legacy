    <h3>User Module</h3>
    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>This module allows you to manage users, groups, and roles defined in the default security realm.</p>
    <p>Users are entities that can be authenticated. Each user is assigned a unique identity within the realm.</p>
    <p>To make it easier to administer a large number of users, users can be organized into named groups.</p>
    <p>Groups can in turn be assigned membership in other groups.</p>
    <p>Only users logged in as a member of the Webmaster group Administrators group can add, delete, or modify a user, group, or role..</p>
