        <p>Control Panel > Settings > Image Management</p>

        <h3>Category management</h3>
        <p>Here you can create and edit categories, set the maximum file size, maximum image width and height, display and hide categories and images.</p>
        <p>The following options are available when creating a category:</p>

        <h3>Name</h3>
        <p>A descriptive name of the category.</p>

        <h3>Permissions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Groups who can upload to the category.</li>
            <li>Groups who can view the category.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>File size</h3>
        <p>You can optionally set a maximum allowed size in kilobytes for uploaded file. Leave blank if you do not wish to impose a limit.
        <p>Example: 1024000 bytes = 1,000Kb = 1MB

        <div class="tips">
            Note: Servers usually also have built-in limits on the amount of data that can be uploaded via PHP at one time.
            The default value for this in PHP is 2 MB. If you have a need to upload very large files, then you should contact
            your Host or server admin and talk to them about any size limits they have in place.
        </div>

        <h3>Image width</h3>
        <p>Optionally set the maximum allowed width in pixes for uploaded images. Images over this setting will be automatically resized.

        <h3>Image height</h3>
        <p>Optionally set the maximum allowed height in pixes for uploaded images. Images over this setting will be automatically resized

        <h3>Display</h3>
        <p>Show or hide the category</p>

        <h3>Order</h3>
        <p>In the list component, you can sort by any column. Leave the value by default for the original sort order, or set a custom order with a numeric value.</p>

        <h3>Category store type</h3>
        <p>Choose either the file or the database storage scheme for your image files.
        <div class="error">This setting cannot be changed later ! </div>
        <p>Keep in mind that if you select the database as the storage destination, image files will be stored as BLOB type data which may not be suitable for backup purposes.</p>

        <h3>Word Censor</h3>
        <p>Control Panel > Preferences > Word Censorship</p>
        <p>This section of the Control Panel allows you to enable word censoring.
            It is also where you define the list of censored words.</p>

        <h3>Enable censorship?</h3>
        <p>You may enable or disable word censoring. If you select “Yes”, the system will replace any specified words
            in channel entries, comments, forum posts, etc. according to your preference below.</p>

        <h3>Replacement characters</h3>
        <p>You may optionally specify a word or phrase to be used when replacing censored words.
            For example, if you set “tisk tisk” as your replacement word, and “shucks” is in your censored list,
            then anytime “shucks” is used it will be replaced with “tisk tisk”.
            If you do not set this preference, a pound symbol will be used for each character that is censored,
            so “shucks” would be converted to “######“.</p>

        <h3>Words to censor</h3>
        <p>Specify a list of words to censor. Wildcards are allowed. For example, test* would censor the words “test”,
            “testing”, and “tester”, while *gress would censor the words “progress” and “congress”.</p>
        <p>The profanity filter, sometimes referred to as just "filter" or "censor", is a feature typically used on
            forums and comments that automatically scans users' posts as they are submitted and automatically changes
            or censors particular words.</p>
        <p>Enter the censored words in the textarea using a common delimiter character "|" (pipe) to separate the values.</p>
        <p>Set the characters replacing all the censored words in the input field "censor-replace".</p>
        <div class="tips">Check the GitHub repository of Shutterstock list of bad words used for filtering<br>

        <ul>
            <li>The XCL version 2.3.x ensures compatibility with Legacy modules, OOP or Object Oriented Programming, class abstraction and interfaces.
            <li>In 2017 major PHP projects started bug fixing and code refactoring to PHP 7.
            <li>In computer programming and software design, code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without

            <li>Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and implementation of the software, while preserving its functionality.
            <li>Moreover, the design and code refactoring of XCL primarily provides backward compatibility and updates modules based on Duplicatable V3 (D3) architecture.
