    <h4>Version</h4>
    <ul>

      <li>In 2017 major PHP projects started bug fixing and code refactoring to PHP 7.
      <li>In computer programming and software design, code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing the factoring—without
          changing its external behavior.
       <li>Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and implementation of the software, while preserving its functionality.
       <li>Moreover, the design and code refactoring of XCL primarily provides backward compatibility and updates modules based on Duplicatable V3 (D3) architecture.
       <li>Content creation, filemanager with cloud storage management, WYSIWYG editor and X-Update to get and deploy from a simple user interface.

        <h3>Image Management</h3>
        <p>The image management features solve the challenges of storing, organising and distributing images currently in-use and in your platform.
            Architected around a centralised storage space, an image management platform provides features that help people categorise,
            share and retrieve the images they need.
            The default Image management can be considered a specialised type of digital asset management (DAM) platform.
            Like a DAM, today’s image management solutions are typically built in the cloud, offering a large and secure storage space for libraries
            that might extend to hundreds of thousands – even millions – of assets.</p>
