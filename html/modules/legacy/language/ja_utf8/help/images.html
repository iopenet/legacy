        <h3>Image Management</h3>
        <p>Control Panel > Settings > Image Management</p>

        <h3>Category management</h3>
        <p>Here you can create and edit categories, set the maximum file size, maximum image width and height, display and hide categories and images.</p>
        <p>The following options are available when creating a category:</p>

        <h3>Name</h3>
        <p>A descriptive name of the category.</p>

        <h3>Permissions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Groups who can upload to the category.</li>
            <li>Groups who can view the category.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>File size</h3>
        <p>You can optionally set a maximum allowed size in kilobytes for uploaded file. Leave blank if you do not wish to impose a limit.
        <p>Example: 1024000 bytes = 1,000Kb = 1MB

        <div class="tips">
            Note: Servers usually also have built-in limits on the amount of data that can be uploaded via PHP at one time.
            The default value for this in PHP is 2 MB. If you have a need to upload very large files, then you should contact
            your Host or server admin and talk to them about any size limits they have in place.
        </div>

        <h3>Image width</h3>
        <p>Optionally set the maximum allowed width in pixes for uploaded images. Images over this setting will be automatically resized.

        <h3>Image height</h3>
        <p>Optionally set the maximum allowed height in pixes for uploaded images. Images over this setting will be automatically resized

        <h3>Display</h3>
        <p>Show or hide the category</p>

        <h3>Order</h3>
        <p>In the list component, you can sort by any column. Leave the value by default for the original sort order, or set a custom order with a numeric value.</p>

        <h3>Category store type</h3>
        <p>Choose either the file or the database storage scheme for your image files.
        <div class="error">This setting cannot be changed later ! </div>
        <p>Keep in mind that if you select the database as the storage destination, image files will be stored as BLOB type data which may not be suitable for backup purposes.</p>


        <h3>Image Batch-Upload (Graphics)</h3>
        <p>You can easily register many images by uploading a compressed archive!
        <p>This batch-upload doesn't check Length and File-Size of each image!<br>
            Please pre-adjust them before you archive!<br>
            (Only tar.gz or zip archive)</p>

        <h3>Upload directory</h3>
        <p>The default directory for Uploads is /public_html/uploads/<br>
        </p>

        <pre><code class="lang-smarty">&lt;{$smarty.const.XOOPS_UPLOAD_URL}&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>or use :</p>

        <pre><code class="lang-smarty">&lt;{$xoops_upload_url}&gt;</code></pre>


        <p>The full URL to the new image is generated by Image Management. However, if you transfer files via FTP.
            it's recommended to use the default base URL variable. For example: <code class="lang-smarty">&lt;{${xoops_url}/uploads/filename.png}&gt;</code>
        </p>

        <h3>Allowed file types</h3>
        <p>You have two choices for this preference:
        <p>1. Images only: The default Image Management settings will only allow image files of the type GIF, JPG, JPEG, or PNG.
        <p>2. Install XelFinder File Manager and set other file types:<br>
            XelFinder allows you to upload files of any type to the system.<br>
            Be careful with this setting since it could be possible for someone to upload a malicious file.</p>


        <h3>Install XelFinder File Manager</h3>

        <p>The image management features solve the challenges of storing, organising and distributing images currently in-use and in your platform.
            Architected around a centralised storage space, an image management platform provides features that help people categorise,
            share and retrieve the images they need.
            The default Image management can be considered a specialised type of digital asset management (DAM) platform.
            Like a DAM, today’s image management solutions are typically built in the cloud, offering a large and secure storage space for libraries
            that might extend to hundreds of thousands – even millions – of assets.</p>

        <div class="tips">XelFinder is easily integrated and extended to manage local and cloud storage services such as Google Drive, OneDrive or Dropbox.</div>
